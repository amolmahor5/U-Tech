        question: "What is biometric software?",
        answer:
            "Biometric software is a technology used to confirm or determine a person's identity based on unique physiological or behavioral characteristics. These traits can include fingerprints, retinas or irises, voice patterns, facial features, and hand measurements. Biometric systems capture and analyze these traits, creating biometric templates for comparison and identification purposes. This software is widely used in various applications, such as access control, time and attendance tracking, security systems, and user authentication on devices like smartphones and computers.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does a biometric system work?",
        answer:
            "A biometric system operates by capturing biometric data from an individual, such as fingerprints, retinas, voice patterns, facial features, or hand measurements. Using a specialized algorithm, the system extracts unique characteristics from the data to create a biometric template. This template is then compared to the stored biometric database to verify the person's identity.",

    {
        question: "How is AI used in biometrics?",
        answer:
            "AI plays a vital role in biometrics, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. It is used for advanced pattern recognition, identifying unique traits like fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, and voice. AI-powered systems continuously learn from new data, improving recognition over time. Additionally, AI helps prevent spoofing with liveness detection and enables efficient search and matching against large databases. Personalization, real-time decision-making, and improving overall system accuracy are other areas where AI excels in biometrics.",
