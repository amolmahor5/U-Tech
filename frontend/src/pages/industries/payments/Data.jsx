    question: "How does payment software work?",
    answer:
      "Payment software uses encryption to secure transactions, and may rely on various payment methods such as credit/debit cards, bank transfers, SMS payments, mobile payments or digital wallets. When a payment is initiated, the software sends a request to the appropriate financial institution to transfer the funds. Once the transfer is complete, the software confirms the transaction and updates the relevant records.",
